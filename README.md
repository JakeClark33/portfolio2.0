## Introduction 
The following portfolio was created using react. The page displays projects I have or am working on. Upon logging into the page you are presented with the About Me section. You may click on any of the nav bar items to view other parts of the page such as projects. If you click on a project image you will be presented with thumbnail images. If you click on an image you will get a description of the project and a link to the GitHub repo. A downloadable version of my resume is present as well and other contact methods and professional reference links at the bottom of the page. There is also an option to contact me directly via email. Just fill out the form and submit your message.
